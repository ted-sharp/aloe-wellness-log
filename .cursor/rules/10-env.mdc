I'm using Windows 10 version 22H2 with PowerShell 7 as my terminal.
Please tailor all instructions and commands accordingly.
Before running any npm command, confirm that the project is set up to use npm rather than yarn.
Before running npm or yarn, always check whether the command needs to be executed outside the repository root.
